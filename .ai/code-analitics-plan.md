1. DashboardProvider.tsx (331 lines)
This file is overly complex and needs refactoring:
Extract Query Building Logic: The query building logic for fetching meetings and counting is duplicated. Create a separate function buildMeetingsQuery that applies filters to a query.
Custom Hook for API Operations: Extract the API operations (fetchMeetings, createMeeting, deleteMeeting) into a custom hook like useMeetingsApi in the hooks directory.
Split Components: Separate the loading state JSX into its own component to reduce the size of the provider.
Use React.useCallback: The functions like fetchMeetings, createMeeting, and deleteMeeting should be wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Implement Error Boundary Pattern: Instead of throwing errors directly, consider creating a proper error handling pattern.
2. PreferencesForm.tsx (238 lines)
This form component can be improved:
Extract Form Sections: Break down the form into smaller components for each section (distribution preferences, time preferences, weekday preferences).
Custom Hook for Form Logic: Create a usePreferencesForm hook that handles form submission and validation logic.
Memoize Form Sections: Use React.memo for each extracted form section to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Consolidate Form Field Components: Create a reusable component for checkbox groups to reduce repetition between preferred times and unavailable weekdays.
Use Suspense for Data Loading: Implement React.Suspense for better loading state management instead of the current approach.
3. ProposalsPage.tsx (222 lines)
Refactoring suggestions:
Extract Dialog Component: Move the conflict confirmation dialog to its own component file.
Custom Hook for API Calls: Create a useProposals hook that handles fetching and managing proposal data.
Form State Management: Use React.useReducer instead of multiple useState calls to manage related form state.
Extract Proposal List Component: Create a separate ProposalList component to handle rendering the list of proposals.
Apply Early Return Pattern: Use early returns for loading and error states instead of nested conditionals.
4. RegisterForm.tsx (184 lines)
Improvements for the auth form:
Extract Validation Logic: Move the validation logic to a custom hook like useFormValidation.
Implement Form Libraries: Consider using React Hook Form with zod more effectively to replace the manual validation.
Create Reusable Form Field Component: Extract a FormFieldWithValidation component to reduce repetition.
API Client Abstraction: Create an auth service to handle API calls instead of embedding fetch calls in the component.
Use React.memo: Apply React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders for stable child components.
5. use-toast.ts (189 lines)
This utility can be improved:
Use Context API More Effectively: Consolidate the toast context management to follow modern React patterns.
Split State Management: Separate the reducer logic into a dedicated file.
TypeScript Enhancements: Improve type definitions with more specific types rather than using generic React.ReactNode.
Custom Hook for Animation: Extract animation timing logic into a separate hook.
Test Coverage: Add unit tests for each toast action to ensure reliability.
These refactoring suggestions align with the project's technical stack (React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind 4) and follow the best practices mentioned in the tech-stack.md file. The changes would significantly improve code maintainability, performance, and readability.
